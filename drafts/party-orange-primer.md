# ✴️🍊Party Orange Primer

## What Is Party Orange?

Party Orange is not a political party. We're a secure, member-owned civic platform built to clearly manifest the collective will of the American people—free from billionaire influence, candidate manipulation, or algorithmic distortion. We provide infrastructure for every American to declare precisely where they stand on the issues that matter, creating an undeniable, durable record of our shared civic values.

Think of Party Orange as:
- The connective tissue of a healthy citizenry
- LinkedIn for the citizen self
- A citizen's union
- A safety deposit box for our civic will

## Why Party Orange Exists

America's political system, dominated by partisan divides and financial influence, consistently fails to represent the actual beliefs and values of the American people. Party Orange exists to:

- Create a permanent, unalterable record of public stances
- Ensure privacy and dignity for every member
- Facilitate coalitions based on shared civic values rather than partisan identity
- Reclaim democracy by amplifying authentic citizen voices

Today's political climate urgently demands a space free from manipulation, distortion, and commercialization. Party Orange is that space.

## Our Core Principles

### Citizenry at the Core
- **No "Billions".** No stockholder interests. Only for Americans.
- **No Candidates.** Platformed by the people. Only our stances.
- **No Algorithm.** We never harvest attention, hate bots, and push no agenda.
- **No Ads.** Membership is our fuel and only incentive.


### Privacy and Control
Members control how public or private stances are:
- Visibility defaults for different dispositions
- Adjust visibility for specific question sets
- Control privacy for individual answers
- Permanently anonymize sensitive opinions

### Secure by Design
We treat member data with the utmost respect:
- End-to-end encryption
- Secure databases with strict access control
- Regular security audits
- Minimal data collection
