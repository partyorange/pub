# Party Orange:  Founding Principles – Draft 0.1 for comment

Party Orange is American citizens creating collective power around shared values. We see an urgent need for the consent of the governed and the will of the people to become much more visible, durable, and safe from intimidation. Our voices mean more collectively than they can individually.

So, who is We?

We are all Americans. We agree on many things. We disagree on others. We strongly disagree about some things. We don't all like each other. We don't all trust each other. We don't have to because here every member controls their own stances. We all want a better way to find common ground and reshape the conversations that will determine the future of America. Party Orange fills the role of bringing public infrastructure to the voice of America's people.

The early members agreed in 2025 on the following 10 things and hope those who agree will join us to make it way harder for America's resources, reputation, and power to be used in ways that violate our common values.


1. **Red vs. Blue is failing us.** \
   Neither Red nor Blue are getting better at representing us. We can see America's shared sense of self fraying faster and faster. We see the game of American elections and can't continue to stomach being sold the same empty marketing campaigns under the guise of party platforms and candidate promises. A relatively tiny number of citizens effectively control outcomes that have generational and everyday impacts on millions of us, and all they have to do is be in a few key chairs on the winning team in a never-ending 2-team tournament. Red and Blue are structurally incentivized to divide us into mutually exclusive camps and get us angry and fearful enough about the other side that we'll get to the polls. Influencing the core platforms and operational priorities of either party is something only in reach for those with extreme resources or huge coalitions.

2. **Consent of the governed comes first.** \
   The will of the people precedes the machinery of politics. We aim to be pre-partisan more than non-partisan. The will of our members will show up in very partisan ways, so the Party Orange culture centers people's individual values and sentiments without any pre-ordained platform or agenda other than to be sure every voice is heard. Our model centers the citizen, giving us all a direct, bottom-up view of our collective will. The agenda and interests of our members emerges from first principles. Coalitions that shape the civil sphere are healthier when they form and grow from shared values. 

3. **Expressing honest social opinions shouldn't be risky, but it is.** \
   To properly express the will of the people, we must protect individual anonymity while enabling collective amplification and coalition building. Protecting individuals' ability to express opinions without fear of reprisal is fundamental to manifesting genuine collective will. Party Orange operates with member data as if its a precious personal asset, because it is.

4. **A return to healthy partisanship requires new ways to find common ground** \
   Red vs. Blue won't get us to a reasonable level of disagreement until there's some way to build the set of shared values that undergird a strong nation. America is a nation built on values, not identities, yet its our identities used against us time and time again by those in power. Party Orange aims to build a new durable infrastructure to give us all a better sense of our commonality, so we can coexist and thrive.

5. **Nobody is coming to save us but us.** \
   We start Party Orange because we see no institution that will represent our collective will.  We fund ourselves on a sliding scale to ensure everyone can join and nobody can exert undue control. No ads, so it’s never about selling our attention or letting algorithms seduce us to pay attention. No billionaire agenda or financial dependencies, so it’s unassailably ours. In anything we do, we each control how we express our views and who gets access.

6. **Collective power is more important than performative unity.** \
   Coalescing coalitions is healthier than partisan loyalties. Party Orange reveals unexpected alliances across traditional divides by showing people where they actually agree rather than emphasizing differences. This creates new political possibilities beyond the artificial constraints of Red vs. Blue, enabling action on issues with genuine consensus. Party Orange isn't about feel-good consensus.  Politicians and media currently spend billions to understand what we believe; with Party Orange, we see a future where they come to us.&#x20;

7. **We have to own our own infrastructure.** \
   If we don’t hold the keys, someone else sets the rules. We’re building tech that keeps data in our hands and can’t be rewritten by whoever buys the server farm. This isn't about creating another group on a social platform designed to harvest our attention.
