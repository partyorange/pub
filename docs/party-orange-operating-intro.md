# Party Orange Operating Plan  
*We are building the civic infrastructure no one else will.*

---

## What This Is

This is the operating plan for Party Orange—  
a member-powered civic platform that builds what our country is missing:  
a durable, visible, and uncorrupted record of the will of We, the People.

We’re not here to sell anyone anything.
We’re here as citizens to have control over our voice and safe pathways to caoaltions based on shared values. 

---

## Why We’re Doing This

Because if we don’t, here’s what happens:

- **Our opinion stays a black box**—harvested by pollsters, buried by consultants.  
- **Our discourse stays rigid and rigged**—the same Red vs Blue punditry, gamed by billionaires.  
- **Our civic identity stays manipulable**—reduced to the marketing slogans of Red vs Blue.

There is no shared record of where we actually stand.  
No structure for finding who stands with us.  
No platform that counts us without using us.

Until now.

## What Makes This Different

- **Not polling.** We build a durable, member-controlled, privacy-first stance record.  
- **Not social media.** Our architecture favors privacy, clarity, and truth—not clicks.  
- **Not partisan.** Power flows from consensus and consent, not candidates and campaigns.  
 
This isn’t another forum, feed, or fundraising tool, though we plan to either build or enable all such applications. 
This is infrastructure for the next civic era—built to resist corruption and endure beyond election cycles.

## Why We Must Be Member-Funded

This isn’t about moral purity.  
It’s about architectural survival.

- **Venture capital** must extract outsized equity value to work.
- **Institutional philanthropy** bends strategy toward grant cycles.  
- **Political fundraisers** always pull toward candidate capture.

When we’re funded by members, our incentives stay 100% aligned with the citizens who join. 
More importantly, it allows us to make durable promises about privacy, data ownership, and other forms of future-proofing the trust so essential for our mission to succeed. 
Our features serve people, not markets.  
Our growth follows trust—not virality.

**No ads. No investors. No hidden machinations.**  
Just members, funding what they own.

## How Sustainability Works

Our first major goal: ~100,000 active, dues-paying members.  
Sliding-scale model: means average could be below $10 per and means average dues per member will fall..  
No paywalls. No tiered access. Everyone counts.

| Members   | Annual Run Rate | Outcome             |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 10,000    | ~$125K          | Demonstrable viability     |
| 100,000   | ~$1M            | Baseline sustainability |
| 1,000,000 | ~$7M            | Margin + endowment  |

## Built for All of Us

Party Orange holds space for a wide range of civic identities and political perspectives.

We don’t aim for neutrality—we aim for accuracy.  
We don’t force consensus—we surface it.  
We don’t collapse disagreement—we map it.

Whether you identify as progressive, conservative, libertarian, disillusioned, or politically homeless—this is infrastructure that sees you, counts you, and protects your voice.

---

## What We’re Asking

We don’t need a donation.  
We need your stance.

- **Join** at a level that works for you  
- **Share** with others who want to speak without being manipulated  
- **Back the runway** if you can—but know we’re walking either way

This is not a startup. Not a campaign.  
This is infrastructure.

And we’re building it together.
