# Party Orange Operating Plan  
*We are building the civic infrastructure no one else will.*

---

## What This Is

This is the operating plan for Party Orange—  
a member-powered civic platform that builds what our country is missing:  
a durable, visible, and uncorrupted record of what We, the People actually believe.

We’re not here to “scale.”  
We’re here to outlast.

---

## Why We’re Doing This

Because if we don’t, here’s what happens:

- **Our opinion stays a black box**—harvested by pollsters, buried by consultants.  
- **Our discourse stays rigged**—polarized by parties, gamed by billionaires.  
- **Our civic identity stays manipulable**—reduced to ad segments and vibes.

There is no shared record of where we actually stand.  
No structure for finding who stands with us.  
No platform that counts us without using us.

Until now.

---

## What Makes This Different

- **Not polling.** We build a durable, member-controlled stance record.  
- **Not social media.** Our architecture favors privacy, clarity, and truth—not clicks.  
- **Not partisan.** Power flows from consensus, not candidates.  

This isn’t another forum, feed, or fundraising tool.  
This is infrastructure for the next civic era—built to resist corruption and endure beyond election cycles.

---

## Why We Must Be Member-Funded

This isn’t about moral purity.  
It’s about architectural survival.

- **Venture capital** demands growth, not dignity.  
- **Institutional philanthropy** bends strategy toward grant cycles.  
- **Political donors** always pull toward candidate capture.

When we’re funded by members, our incentives stay clean.  
Our features serve people, not markets.  
Our growth follows trust—not virality.

**No ads. No investors. No hidden agenda.**  
Just members, funding what they own.

## How Sustainability Works

Our goal: ~100,000 active, dues-paying members.  
Sliding-scale model: $3, $10, or $30+/month.  
No paywalls. No tiered access. Everyone counts.

| Members   | Monthly Revenue (est.) | Annual Run Rate | Outcome             |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| 10,000    | ~$40K                  | ~$500K           | Seed operations     |
| 100,000   | ~$300K                 | ~$3.6M           | Full sustainability |
| 1,000,000 | ~$2.5M                 | ~$30M            | Margin + endowment  |

The math works. The mission demands it.  
Because no one else will build this for us.

## Built for All of Us

Party Orange holds space for a wide range of civic identities and political perspectives.

We don’t aim for neutrality—we aim for accuracy.  
We don’t force consensus—we surface it.  
We don’t collapse disagreement—we map it.

Whether you identify as progressive, conservative, libertarian, disillusioned, or politically homeless—this is infrastructure that sees you, counts you, and protects your voice.

---

## What We’re Asking

We don’t need a donation.  
We need your stance.

- **Join** at a level that works for you  
- **Share** with others who want to speak without being manipulated  
- **Back the runway** if you can—but know we’re walking either way

This is not a startup. Not a campaign.  
This is infrastructure.

And we’re building it together.
