# Party Orange Operating Plan  
*We are building the civic infrastructure no one else will.*

---

## What This Is

This is not a pitch.  
This is the operating plan for Party Orange—  
a member-powered civic platform that builds what this country is missing:  
a durable, visible, and uncorrupted record of what the American people actually believe.

We aren’t trying to “scale.”  
We are trying to outlast.

---

## What Happens If We Don’t

If we don’t build Party Orange, here’s what happens:

- **Public opinion remains a black box**—harvested by pollsters, twisted by pundits, buried by consultants.
- **Discourse remains hostage**—polarized by parties, gamed by billionaires, flattened by algorithms.
- **Civic identity remains manipulable**—sorted by ad segments, not beliefs.

We have no shared record of where we really stand.  
We have no secure way to say: *this is who we are.*

Until now.

## Why This Has to Be Member-Funded

We are not member-funded because it feels righteous.  
We are member-funded because no other funding model makes us safe.

- **Venture money** requires growth at all costs. That leads to engagement tricks, surveillance, and saleable data.
- **Institutional philanthropy** introduces compliance risk, dependency, and softened edges.
- **Political donors** inevitably pull toward candidate capture and ideological distortion.

Party Orange is designed to be accountable only to the people who use it.  
That is not a moral stance.  
That is an *institutional strategy for mission fidelity*.

## How We Get There

To sustain the platform, we need:
- **~100,000 active members** on a sliding-scale dues model.
- A mix of $3, $10, and $30/month contributors.
- No paywalls. Just mutual commitment.

| Members   | Monthly Revenue (est.) | Annual Run Rate | Outcome             |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| 10,000    | ~$40K                  | ~$500K           | Seed operations     |
| 100,000   | ~$300K                 | ~$3.6M           | Full sustainability |
| 1,000,000 | ~$2.5M                 | ~$30M            | Margin + endowment  |

Because no one else will build this for us.

## What We're Asking

We are not asking for donations.  
We are asking you to help build something that belongs to all of us.

- Join at a dues level that fits your life.  
- Share with others who are looking for a way to speak clearly without being used.  
- Fund the runway if you can. But know we’re already walking.

This is not a product. It is not a campaign.  
It is a civic infrastructure project built to survive whatever comes next.
