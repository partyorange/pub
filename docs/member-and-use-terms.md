**Effective Date: May 30, 2025**

### Welcome to Party Orange

By joining Party Orange as a member, you're joining a 501(c)(4) non-profit organization dedicated to manifesting the authentic will of the American people. This Members Agreement ("Agreement") governs your membership and use of our platform.

### 1. Our Mission and Your Membership

**Who We Are**: Party Orange exists to create secure infrastructure where Americans can declare their civic stances free from billionaire influence, candidate manipulation, or algorithmic distortion. We are member-owned and mission-driven.

**Your Role**: As a member, you contribute to a living record of American civic values. Your membership helps build collective power from individual voices, always maintaining complete control over your privacy.

**Membership Rights**: You have the right to:

* Take stances on civic issues through our question sets
* Control the privacy and visibility of all your responses
* Access and modify your data at any time
* Participate in democratic governance processes
* Receive clear information about how your data is used

### 2. Data Use and Advocacy Mission

**Our Core Promise**: Party Orange aggregates member stances to manifest collective will. By joining, you consent to the following uses of your data:

**Permitted Uses**:

* Aggregating anonymized stance data to reflect collective American opinion
* Publishing reports demonstrating American stances on key issues
* Advocating for policies supported by our membership
* Sharing anonymized data with researchers, media, and policymakers
* Creating visualizations and analyses amplifying the people's voice

**Individual Protection**: We will never:

* Sell your personal information
* Share your individual stances without explicit permission
* Allow your identity to be connected to anonymized data
* Use your data for commercial advertising

**Legal Compliance**: While we design systems to protect anonymity rigorously, we cannot guarantee absolute protection against all legal processes. We will:

* Resist overly broad data requests
* Notify you of data requests when legally permitted
* Maintain minimal data necessary for our mission
* Use technical measures to hinder individual identification

### 3. Platform Use and Community Standards

**Authentic Participation**: Party Orange is for genuine civic engagement. You agree to:

* Provide truthful responses reflecting your actual views
* Use the platform only for intended civic purposes
* Respect other members' privacy and differing opinions

### 4. Privacy Controls and Anonymization

**Your Control**: You maintain complete control over:

* Default profile visibility settings
* Privacy levels for individual question sets
* Answer visibility (public, members-only, private, anonymous)

**True Anonymization**: When you anonymize a response:

* It becomes permanently disconnected from your identity
* Only the question, answer, and verification level remain
* No technical method can relink the response to you
* Data contributes to aggregate insights only

**Aggregation Thresholds**: We never show aggregated results until sufficient responses ensure individual privacy.

### 5. Financial Terms

**Membership Fees**: Our sliding-scale model ensures accessibility and independence:

* Fees support platform operations, security, and advocacy
* No member is excluded due to inability to pay
* Higher-tier members subsidize lower-tier access
