# [DRAFT] Party Orange Data Stewardship & Public Collaboration Policy

## 1. Purpose & Mission Alignment

Party Orange exists to capture and amplify the authentic will of the people. Everything we do—from technology choices to membership engagement—must serve this core mission of strengthening civic participation, fostering trust, and upholding the integrity of member voices. This policy establishes how Party Orange collects, protects, and utilizes data in service of manifesting the collective civic voice of our members.

## 2. Data Collection & Purpose

* **Data Minimization**: Party Orange collects only information necessary to fulfill our core mission. This typically includes:
  - Values profiles derived from scenario-based questions
  - General geographic location (district/region, not precise location)
  - Optional demographic information when relevant to understanding civic representation
  - Account security and verification information

* **Explicit Purpose**: All data collection serves specific, mission-aligned purposes:
  - Revealing genuine values and priorities of members
  - Identifying common ground across traditional dividing lines
  - Creating collective leverage through aggregated civic voice
  - Ensuring system integrity and preventing manipulation

* **Retention Limits**: Personal data is retained only as long as necessary to fulfill these purposes or as required by law, with regular review of retention needs.

## 3. Protection of Member Information

* **Privacy by Design**: Members' personal information is kept confidential by default. We only share or publish data in aggregated or anonymized formats that protect individual identities, unless a member explicitly opts to disclose more.

* **Security Measures**: The organization employs strong encryption, access controls, and regular audits to safeguard member data from unauthorized access, ensuring continued trust in Party Orange as a secure repository of civic voices.

* **Member Control**: Members maintain rights to:
  - Access their complete data profile upon request
  - Correct inaccurate personal information
  - Delete their data and withdraw from participation
  - Control visibility settings (fully private, anonymous contribution to aggregates, selectively public)
  - Export their data in standard formats

* **Government Requests**: Party Orange will resist overly broad requests for member data from government entities and will notify members of requests for their information when legally permitted to do so.

## 4. Data for Collective Leverage

* **Aggregation for Impact**: Party Orange aggregates member values data to reveal patterns, common ground, and collective priorities that create leverage in the civic sphere.

* **Representative Accuracy**: We employ rigorous methodologies to ensure aggregated data accurately represents our membership without amplifying biases or creating false consensus.

* **Making Them Come to Us**: Aggregated data serves our core mission by creating a clear manifestation of members' collective will that political leaders and institutions must respond to rather than ignore.

* **Verification Mechanisms**: Party Orange employs systems to verify the authenticity of participants while preserving privacy, ensuring that our collective voice represents genuine civic will.

## 5. Transparent Public Collaboration

* **Open Approach**: Wherever feasible, Party Orange will make non-sensitive organizational resources openly available to encourage public insight, collaboration, and innovation. These may include:
  - Aggregated values data (with no identifying information)
  - Question frameworks and methodologies
  - Research findings and civic insights
  - Code for non-sensitive systems

* **Research Partnerships**: Party Orange may collaborate with academic and civic researchers under strict protocols that advance our mission while ensuring member privacy.

* **API Access**: When technically feasible, Party Orange will provide structured access to anonymized, aggregated data through APIs that enable broader civic innovation while preserving individual privacy.

* **Responsible Use**: Party Orange may publish de-identified, aggregated data to inform public discussions, highlight community concerns, and advance our 501(c)(4) mission, while strictly preserving individual privacy.

## 6. Brand & Authenticity

* **Organizational Identity**: Party Orange retains the exclusive right to its name, logos, and trademarks, ensuring that any public representation of our work aligns with our values and commitment to impartiality and accuracy.

* **Avoiding Misrepresentation**: No external entity may imply endorsement or official affiliation with Party Orange without express written consent. This preserves the integrity of our brand and the authenticity of our communications.

* **Clear Attribution**: Public use of Party Orange data must include clear attribution and context to prevent misrepresentation of findings or member values.

## 7. Independence & Accountability

* **Member Interests First**: Party Orange does not sell member data or prioritize commercial interests over civic goals. Revenue streams and partnerships must support, rather than fundamentally undermine, our commitment to member-driven democracy.

* **Independence Safeguards**: To prevent capture by special interests:
  - No individual or entity may provide more than 5% of Party Orange's annual budget
  - Full transparency in funding sources will be maintained
  - No political party or candidate committee may provide financial support
  - Board members must disclose potential conflicts of interest

* **Regular Audits**: Party Orange will conduct regular data protection and mission alignment audits, publishing results to members.

* **Governing Oversight**: All major policy decisions, including those affecting data handling or organizational structure, require review by Party Orange's governing body to ensure alignment with our core mission and compliance with legal requirements.

## 8. Implementation & Enforcement

* **Chief Data Steward**: Party Orange will designate a senior role responsible for overseeing implementation of this policy and ensuring data practices serve member interests.

* **Transparency Reports**: We will publish regular reports detailing how data is being used, protected, and leveraged for collective impact.

* **Violation Remediation**: Breaches of this policy will trigger immediate review, remediation, notification to affected members where appropriate, and structural improvements to prevent recurrence.

* **Member Feedback**: Party Orange will maintain accessible channels for members to report concerns about data practices and suggest improvements.

## 9. Amendments & Public Notice

* **Adaptive Governance**: This policy may be amended over time to reflect legal developments or the evolving needs of our membership. Any material changes will be communicated promptly and transparently with:
  - Advance notice before implementation
  - Clear explanation of changes and rationale
  - Opportunity for member feedback

* **Legal Compliance**: Party Orange will seek appropriate legal counsel to maintain compliance with 501(c)(4) regulations, privacy laws (including applicable principles from frameworks such as GDPR and CCPA), and other relevant statutes while fulfilling our core mission.
